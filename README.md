# HotOrCold
Guess game !

This Python code is a simple guessing game called "Hot or Cold." The user is prompted to guess a number between 0 and 1000, and the game will provide feedback based on how close the guess is to the randomly generated number. If the guess is within 10 of the number, it will say "HOT", if within 100, it will say "You're getting there", otherwise it will say "Cold". The game also allows the user to play again or exit after they guess the number correctly.

The code includes a unittest module that checks whether the generated number is within the specified range (0 to 1000) and whether the user's guess is an integer.
